He seemed annoyed about me coming in to order, and no eye contact. The iced coffee was also super bitter and he just put it on the counter, then hurried away. I also didn't mind reaching behind the counter to get a straw, but it was just weird. Maybe he had a bad day, I don't know.                                     2\n",
